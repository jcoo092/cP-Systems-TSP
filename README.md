The accompanying code for our paper on solving the Travelling Salesman Problem in cP Systems

Building and running the F# progam is simple - simply run fsc on the code file to compile it, and then run the output executable.  Different problems can be specified by modifying the adjacency list C, specified as a 2D array in lines 3 to 9.

Running the Prolog program is equally simple.  Merely 'consult' the program in SWI-Prolog, and then ask for the result by typing "go(M)." at the prompt.  Different problems can be specified by modifying the e objects defined at the start, and then appropriately updated the v and n objects.
